I have had a passion for software engineering ever since I took my first programming class in my senior year of high school. Something about being able to create nearly anything using code has never ceased to be intriguing to me.

At the University of Illinois Chicago, I have explored this passion further, creating bigger and more complex programs year after year in languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, R, and SQL.

As I get closer to finishing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I have learned about database systems and SQL, as well as testing frameworks such as JUnit, and I am looking forward to utilizing these skills at a Chicago-based company in the near future.

Academics: Applied Statistical Methods, Programming Practicum, Data Structures, Software Design, Systems Programming, Computer Algorithms I, Principles of Concurrent Programming, and Database Systems
